# Radial-Clock
A simple radial clock written in Lua using LÖVE for the graphics/running it.

To use it in its present state, you need to download [LÖVE](http://love2d.org/) and install it. On Windows, simply double click "run src.bat" (assuming you have installed the 64 bit version). On Mac/Linux, I expect you to know how to use the terminal...

F - toggle fullscreen
G - fake fullscreen (full screen in borderless window)
B - toggle borderless window

I'm thinking about looking up how to make a Windows Desktop Widget and making this in that too...
